TODO:
- handle error when 'npm ls' does not work

ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
- refactor code
- center the camera on clicked node when expanding tree
- add ability to audit vulnerabilities and record them in graph, display it using appropriate colors (can add a seperate option)

IDEAS:
? instead of always generating graph data, use packagelock.json instead
? add a feature for python projects
? add a feature for ruby projects

BUGS:
- workspace must have all npm packages installed in order to run 'npm-ls'
    SOLUTION: make user install packages since package-lock.json is not a reliable source of info as different versions of npm
              append their own key:value pairs
