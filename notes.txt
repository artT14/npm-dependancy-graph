Foundation:
- Vanilla HTML + JS
- WebViews API - https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview

For Graph Visualization:
- https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/best-free-javascript-graph-visualization-libraries--cms-41710

For Graph Data Parsing:
- npm ls --json --all 
- npm audit --json --all


TODO:
1) Create a command that parses package-lock.json instead


ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
- hide some nodes, since there are alot then let user expand them
- color it make it look nice
- refactor code

IDEAS:
? instead of always generating graph data, use packagelock.json instead
? add a feature for python projects
? add a feature for ruby projects

BUGS:
- workspace must have all npm packages installed in order to run 'npm-ls'
    POS SOL-> might resort to giving 2 options => 1 to view full graph and one to view package-lock.json tree
