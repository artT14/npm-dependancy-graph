TODO:
- handle error when 'npm ls' does not work

ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
- refactor code
- center the camera on clicked node when expanding tree
- add ability to audit vulnerabilities and record them in graph, display it using appropriate colors (can add a seperate option)
- add loading animation

IDEAS:
? instead of always generating graph data, use packagelock.json instead
? add a feature for python projects
? add a feature for ruby projects

BUGS:
- allow the extension to reactivate when error is handled
